Based on the attached relational model please create the database schema.
Document all the creational SQL (DDL) scripts and save them into a separated create.sql file.
For the implementation you need to use MySQL as database management system (DBMS).
You must create scripts which insert data (at least 5 rows) into every table and store it in a separaated insert.sql file.
The tables should contain different records.
For example: when a column is optional (could be NULL) the table should contain records which has that value and which has not.

Meetup registration status value could be:

Write some DQL scripts for every table with different WHERE clauses (query.sql).
Write scripts for modifying records (modify.sql).
Write scripts for removing some records (remove.sql).
Write scripts for extending at least one table with some new  nullable columns. (append.sql)
